My project is a simple macropad that consists of 5 buttons, a rotary incoder a slider and a .95" oled display all powerd by a xiao 2040!. 
I made this project beucase I found myself constantly struggling with navigating around in my divice. I wouold be slow in changing tabs, closing tabs ext. So, I wanted
to make this so I can navigate faster and more efficently. I also plan on using this micropad as a small controle board for future projects. It has sufficent 
number of buttons and incoders to create a diverse range of actions paired with an oled screen for veiwing information. In short I hope to use this macropad for a variety 
diffrent things that can help me on productivity and combine with future projects to take them to a next level!!!
