My project is a simple macropad that consists of 5 buttons, a rotary incoder a slider and a .95" oled display all powerd by a xiao 2040!. 
I made this project beucase I found myself constantly struggling with navigating around in my divice. I wouold be slow in changing tabs, closing tabs ext. So, I wanted
to make this so I can navigate faster and more efficently. I also plan on using this micropad as a small controle board for future projects. It has sufficent 
number of buttons and incoders to create a diverse range of actions paired with an oled screen for veiwing information. In short I hope to use this macropad for a variety 
diffrent things that can help me on productivity and combine with future projects to take them to a next level!!!

# PCB:
This was my first time building a PCB so the connections look very messy!

# Frameware
* Slider controles volume
* rotary encoder toggles through diffrent tabs
* 5 buttons, so far only decided on 3 buttons: copy, past, open vscode
* Not sure what to use the Oled screen to display.
I will deffenetly be changing the button macros depending on what I do later on.
