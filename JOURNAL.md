# May 26th: Finished the circuit schematics and the PCB layout!

I decided to do the starter project as I felt that it would help me with shortcuts as I am often times slow when it comes to navigating around on my computer and also to learn and build a PCB. I started with the cuircuit schematics on Kicad. This was my first time creating a PCB so I kinda felt lost on where to start, So My cousin helped guide me through this proccess. For my macropad, I wanted it to be simple and still have a good amount of controles. So I settled on 4 mx switches, 1 slider (PTL30-15R1-104B2 - Potentiometer), a Rotary Encoder, an oled .96" display and at the core a Xaio 2040. I did orgiginally wanted 5 buttons but did not have enough pins so I settled on the 4 button design instead. After I did add a Rotary incoder that had a button in it so it did make up for the loss.

Most of the time spent was on the schematics because it took me a while to find a propper slider online to import in and also due to trying to wire a clean schematic. After finishing the schematic I moved to the PCB lay out. I wanted a comfortable feel to it so I designed one that I thought would feel the best in my setup. I might change the lay out later though if I think a new layout might look better. I put the oled screen in the middle. I do want the oled screen to be an an angle so it is easier to view at but I am not yet sure How I would tilte the screen on the pcb! 

That was basically the things I worked on today, found the parts I wanted a designed a pcb that was the best. Tomorrow I want to work on the 3d modle of the macropad case!
